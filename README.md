# Linear-Regression-Solar-radiation-OBJECTIVES:
Implementing ML for linear regression to predict solar radiation levels in the coming years using databases.

## Project Approach

### 1. Understanding the Dataset
  - Examine data structure (columns, types).
  - Identify key factors affecting solar radiation (e.g., temperature, humidity).
  - Detect patterns based on time or location.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
  - Handle missing data (fill or remove).
  - Handle any extreme values (that could affect the model)
  - Adjust data if needed (if features have different ranges)
  - Change categorical data into a usable format if necessary.

### 3. Exploring Relationships and Model 
  - Use graphs to check how features are related to solar radiation.
  - See if the data is simple enough for a linear model to work.
  - Check if any features are too similar to each other and fix it if needed.

### 4. Splitting Data for Training and Testing
  - Split the data into training and testing sets.
  - Make sure the testing set is separate from the training data to avoid bias.
  - Ensure the test data represents real-world situations you want to predict.
